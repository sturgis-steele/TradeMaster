# TradeMaster Discord Bot - Event Handlers
# This file manages Discord event listeners for the TradeMaster bot.
# It handles events like when the bot connects to Discord and when messages are received.
# The event handlers process incoming messages, apply cooldowns for proactive messages,
# and route messages to the appropriate response handlers.
#
# File Interactions:
# - client.py: Events are registered here through setup_events()
# - router_new.py: Messages are sent to Router.analyze() for processing
# - logging.py: Uses logging configuration for event tracking
# - langgraph: Used for workflow management and conversation state
# - tools/*: Various tool modules are used by the router to process messages
